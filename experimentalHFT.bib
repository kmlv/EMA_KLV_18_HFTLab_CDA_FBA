We present results of an experiment in which two, three and four identical firms repeatedly interact in this environment. In line with the theoretical prediction, market prices decrease with the number of firms, but on average stay above marginal costs. Pricing is less aggressive in duopolies than in triopolies and tetrapolies. However, independently from the number of firms, pricing is more aggressive than in the theoretical equilibrium. Both the absolute and the relative surpluses increase with the number of firms. Total surplus is close to the equilibrium level, since enhanced consumer surplus through lower prices is counteracted by occasional displacements of the most efficient firm in production.},

abstract = {Bertrand competition under decreasing returns involves a wide interval of pure strategy Nash equilibrium prices. We first present results of experiments in which two, three and four identical firms repeatedly interact in this environment. More firms lead to lower average prices. However, prices remain substantially above the Walrasian level. With more than two firms the predominant market price is 24, a price not predicted by conventional equilibrium theories. This phenomenon can be captured by a simple imitation model and by a focal point explanation. For the long run, the model predicts that prices converge to the Walrasian outcome. We then use data from three new treatments to properly test the influence of imitation and focality. We find that both forces are present, but that imitation dominates in large markets with a long interaction. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Yet, the nature of this effect remains largely unknown, with lab experiments insisting that it is either positive or negative or null, and field experiments suggesting that it is instead curvilinear. Here we shed light on this apparent contradiction by considering a novel class of public goods games inspired to the realistic scenario in which the natural output limits of the public good imply that the benefit of cooperation increases fast for early contributions and then decelerates. We report on a large lab experiment providing evidence that, in this case, group size has a curvilinear effect on cooperation, according to which intermediate-size groups cooperate more than smaller groups and more than larger groups. In doing so, our findings help fill the gap between lab experiments and field experiments and suggest concrete ways to promote large scale cooperation among people.},

This paper demonstrates an approach that allows us to estimate the effects of HFT on market quality using information on daily aggregate volumes of HFT and of LT investors provided by a bulge-bracket broker in two trading environments that are different in terms of electronic liquidity, the evolving Tokyo equity market and the mature London equity market. Our results suggest that HFT is mostly involved in opportunistic liquidity provisioning rather than engaging in predatory strategies, at least for liquid stocks. While HFT market making activity increases short-term intraday volatility and therefore adversely affects transaction costs, this effect is more than offset by the significant compression of bid-ask spreads leading to a net reduction of trading costs for LT investors.},

Using a firm-identified limit-order book dataset we show it is also competition among HFT that influences market quality, and we evaluate the trading dynamics through which the influence occurs. HFT entrants (exiters) increase (decrease) liquidity and improve (harm) price efficiency. In markets with fewer incumbents the impacts are larger. We observe specific behavioral changes consistent with competitive pressure: After Passive HFT entry (exit), incumbent HFT spreads tighten (widen). After Aggressive HFT entry, incumbent order flow loses informedness. HFT trading revenue suggests competition reduces the profitability of HFT. The results show that part of the value of HFT comes from its competitiveness.},

@article{Du2017,
abstract = {This paper studies the impact of increasing trading frequency in financial markets on allocative efficiency. We build and solve a dynamic model of sequential double auctions in which traders trade strategically with demand schedules. Trading needs are generated by time-varying private information of the asset value and private values for owning the asset, as well as quadratic inventory costs. We characterize a linear equilibrium with stationary strategies and its efficiency properties in closed form. Infrequent trading (few double auctions per unit of time) leads to higher volume of beneficial trades in each double auction, but frequent trading allows more immediate asset reallocation after new information arrives. To maximize allocative efficiency, the optimal trading frequency coincide with the information arrival frequency for scheduled information releases, but can far exceed the information arrival frequency for stochastic information arrivals. A simple calibration suggests that the optimal trading frequency for liquid futures contracts and stocks is in the order of milliseconds per auction, whereas some very illiquid stocks have an optimal trading frequency in the order of seconds or minutes per auction.},

abstract = {More than half a century after the first experiment on the finitely repeated prisoner's dilemma, evidence on whether cooperation decreases with experience— as suggested by backward induction—remains inconclusive. This article provides ameta-analysis of prior experimental research and reports the results of a new experiment to elucidate how cooperation varies with the environment in this canonical game.We describe forces that affect initial play (formation of cooperation) and unraveling (breakdown of cooperation). First, contrary to the backward induction prediction, the parameters of the repeated game have a significant effect on initial cooperation. We identify how these parameters impact the value of cooperation— as captured by the size of the basin of attraction of always defect—to account for an important part of this effect. Second, despite these initial differences, the evolution of behavior is consistent with the unraveling logic of backward induction for all parameter combinations. Importantly, despite the seemingly contradictory results across studies, this article establishes a systematic pattern of behavior: subjects converge to use threshold strategies that conditionally cooperate until a threshold round; conditional on establishing cooperation, the first defection round moves earlier with experience. Simulation results generated from a learning model estimated at the subject level provide insights into the long-term dynamics and the forces that slow down the unraveling of cooperation},

abstract = {How fast should a security trade? To answer this question, we model the trading of a security via periodic batch auctions and study how market quality is affected as the clearing frequency is changed. In the model, the optimal clearing frequency depends on three factors: (1) the volatility of the security, (2) the intensity of trading in the security, and (3) the correlation of the security's value with other securities. Using rough estimates for these values, we determine that the ideal interval of trade for a typical U.S. stock is currently 0.2 to 0.9 seconds. Our analysis suggests that speed is important in financial markets and that time delays of even a fraction of a second can harm market quality. On the other hand, our results also suggest that for many securities, milli-and microsecond speeds are unnecessary.},

AT represent 52{\%} of market order volume and 64{\%} of nonmarketable limit order volume. AT more actively monitor market liquidity than human traders. AT consume liquidity when it is cheap, i.e., when the bid-ask quotes are narrow, and supply liquidity when it is expensive. When spreads are narrow AT are less likely to submit new orders, less likely to cancel their orders, and more likely to initiate trades. AT react more quickly to events and even more so when spreads are wide.},

abstract = {High-frequency traders (HFTs) accounted for 40{\%} of NASDAQ volume in 2009, but we know little about how their trading affects liquidity. This study examines one means by which HFTs could increase non-HFTs' trading costs—namely, by anticipating and trading ahead of their order flow. I find that HFTs' aggressive purchases and sales lead those of other investors. The effect is stronger at times when non-HFTs may be more impatient, such as near the market open, on high volume and high imbalance days, and for stocks with wide bid-ask spreads. I explore whether these results are explained by HFTs reacting faster to news, positive-feedback trading by non-HFTs, or HFTs and non- HFTs trading on the same signals, but the results are best explained by the anticipatory trading hypothesis. Consistent with the idea that such trading is related to HFT skill, there is persistence in which HFTs' trades best forecast order flow, and these HFTs' trades are more highly correlated with future returns. While it is probable HFTs on net improve liquidity, these findings support the existence of an anticipatory trading channel through which HFTs may increase non-HFT trading costs.},

@incollection{Holt1995,
abstract = {Despite the contrast between the relative simplicity of the laboratory and the complexity of most naturally occurring markets, there is a well-established tradition of experimental research in the field of industrial organization (IO). Indeed, the first market experiment resulted from Edward Chamberlin's conjectures about the imperfect nature of competition. This chapter will survey the extensive experimental literature that is motivated by IO issues, beginning in sections 2 and 3 with the story of how economists initially became interested in experimentation, and with a discussion of the potential usefulness of laboratory techniques in this area. Section 4 contains a review of some procedural issues that arise in the conduct of market experiments. One pervasive theme is the importance of the rules and informational conditions of the laboratory market institution. Section 5 contains descriptions and comparisons of the trading institutions that are used in the study of industrial organization issues. The four substantive sections that follow are organized around traditional topics: monopoly regulation and potential entry, concentration and market power, conditions that facilitate cooperation, and product differentiation. One set of issues to be considered is the extent to which a monopoly seller can exercise market power in the laboratory, whether this power can be protected with predatory pricing, and whether contestability and decentralized regulatory mechanisms mitigate this power. A second set of issues is based on the usefulness of simple concentration measures: do they predict supra-competitive pricing, or it is necessary to consider more subtle notions of market power? Contracts, trading rules, communications, and other factors that do and do not seem to facilitate cooperation in laboratory situations are discussed. In experiments with interrelated markets, the discussion covers failures (due to asymmetric quality information) and successes (where competition generates efficient coordination across markets).},

abstract = {We conduct oligopoly competition experiments with differentiated goods in discrete and continuous time. Continuous time experiments allow for real-time, asynchronous strategic interaction and are therefore argued to be a more realistic mode of interaction, particularly in the context of (electronic) markets. We consider duopolies and triopolies both under Bertrand as well as Cournot competition and consistently find that, ceteris paribus, tacit collusion is higher under discrete time than under continuous time, which contrasts the theoretical prediction. Thus, our results bear important methodological implications for research on oligopoly competition.},

abstract = {Recent theoretical research on oligopolistic competition suggests that under certain conditions prices increase with the number of competing firms. However, this counterintuitive result is based on comparative-static analyses which neglect the importance of dynamic strategies in naturally-occurring markets. When firms compete repeatedly, supra-competitive prices can become sustainable but this is arguably more difficult when more firms operate in the market. This paper reports the results of laboratory experiments investigating pricing behavior in a setting in which (static) theory predicts the counterintuitive number effect. Under a random matching protocol, which retains much of the one-shot nature of the model, the data corroborates the game-theoretic prediction. Under fixed matching duopolists post substantially higher prices, whereas prices in quadropolies remain very similar. As a result, the predicted effect is no longer observed, and towards the end the reverse effect is observed.},
