abstract = {With the proliferation of high-frequency trading (HFT), understanding the effects of HFT on market quality and the opportunities that HFT creates for long-term (LT) investors is important in building an efficient regulatory framework. This paper demonstrates an approach that allows us to estimate the effects of HFT on market quality using information on daily aggregate volumes of HFT and of LT investors provided by a bulge-bracket broker in two trading environments that are different in terms of electronic liquidity, the evolving Tokyo equity market and the mature London equity market. Our results suggest that HFT is mostly involved in opportunistic liquidity provisioning rather than engaging in predatory strategies, at least for liquid stocks. While HFT market making activity increases short-term intraday volatility and therefore adversely affects transaction costs, this effect is more than offset by the significant compression of bid-ask spreads leading to a net reduction of trading costs for LT investors.},

Using a firm-identified limit-order book dataset we show it is also competition among HFT that influences market quality, and we evaluate the trading dynamics through which the influence occurs. HFT entrants (exiters) increase (decrease) liquidity and improve (harm) price efficiency. In markets with fewer incumbents the impacts are larger. We observe specific behavioral changes consistent with competitive pressure: After Passive HFT entry (exit), incumbent HFT spreads tighten (widen). After Aggressive HFT entry, incumbent order flow loses informedness. HFT trading revenue suggests competition reduces the profitability of HFT. The results show that part of the value of HFT comes from its competitiveness.},

This chapter also describes the main findings on transaction prices and volume. Price deviations from competitive equilibrium tend to be smallest in the SCM. Volume is highest in CDA, decreases with call frequency in MCM and SCM, and is lowest in UPDA. The body of this chapter describes the institutions, environment, performance measures, and results.},

abstract = {This paper studies the impact of increasing trading frequency in financial markets on allocative efficiency. We build and solve a dynamic model of sequential double auctions in which traders trade strategically with demand schedules. Trading needs are generated by time-varying private information of the asset value and private values for owning the asset, as well as quadratic inventory costs. We characterize a linear equilibrium with stationary strategies and its efficiency properties in closed form. Infrequent trading (few double auctions per unit of time) leads to higher volume of beneficial trades in each double auction, but frequent trading allows more immediate asset reallocation after new information arrives. To maximize allocative efficiency, the optimal trading frequency coincide with the information arrival frequency for scheduled information releases, but can far exceed the information arrival frequency for stochastic information arrivals. A simple calibration suggests that the optimal trading frequency for liquid futures contracts and stocks is in the order of milliseconds per auction, whereas some very illiquid stocks have an optimal trading frequency in the order of seconds or minutes per auction.},

abstract = {How fast should a security trade? To answer this question, we model the trading of a security via periodic batch auctions and study how market quality is affected as the clearing frequency is changed. In the model, the optimal clearing frequency depends on three factors: (1) the volatility of the security, (2) the intensity of trading in the security, and (3) the correlation of the security's value with other securities. Using rough estimates for these values, we determine that the ideal interval of trade for a typical U.S. stock is currently 0.2 to 0.9 seconds. Our analysis suggests that speed is important in financial markets and that time delays of even a fraction of a second can harm market quality. On the other hand, our results also suggest that for many securities, milli-and microsecond speeds are unnecessary.},

@article{Hirschey2013,
abstract = {High-frequency traders (HFTs) accounted for 40\% of NASDAQ volume in 2009, but we know little about how their trading affects liquidity. This study examines one means by which HFTs could increase non-HFTs’ trading costs—namely, by anticipating and trading ahead of their order flow. I find that HFTs’ aggressive purchases and sales lead those of other investors. The effect is stronger at times when non-HFTs may be more impatient, such as near the market open, on high volume and high imbalance days, and for stocks with wide bid-ask spreads. I explore whether these results are explained by HFTs reacting faster to news, positive-feedback trading by non-HFTs, or HFTs and non- HFTs trading on the same signals, but the results are best explained by the anticipatory trading hypothesis. Consistent with the idea that such trading is related to HFT skill, there is persistence in which HFTs’ trades best forecast order flow, and these HFTs’ trades are more highly correlated with future returns. While it is probable HFTs on net improve liquidity, these findings support the existence of an anticipatory trading channel through which HFTs may increase non-HFT trading costs.},

@incollection{Holt1995,
abstract = {Despite the contrast between the relative simplicity of the laboratory and the complexity of most naturally occurring markets, there is a well-established tradition of experimental research in the field of industrial organization (IO). Indeed, the first market experiment resulted from Edward Chamberlin’s conjectures about the imperfect nature of competition. This chapter will survey the extensive experimental literature that is motivated by IO issues, beginning in sections 2 and 3 with the story of how economists initially became interested in experimentation, and with a discussion of the potential usefulness of laboratory techniques in this area. Section 4 contains a review of some procedural issues that arise in the conduct of market experiments. One pervasive theme is the importance of the rules and informational conditions of the laboratory market institution. Section 5 contains descriptions and comparisons of the trading institutions that are used in the study of industrial organization issues. The four substantive sections that follow are organized around traditional topics: monopoly regulation and potential entry, concentration and market power, conditions that facilitate cooperation, and product differentiation. One set of issues to be considered is the extent to which a monopoly seller can exercise market power in the laboratory, whether this power can be protected with predatory pricing, and whether contestability and decentralized regulatory mechanisms mitigate this power. A second set of issues is based on the usefulness of simple concentration measures: do they predict supra-competitive pricing, or it is necessary to consider more subtle notions of market power? Contracts, trading rules, communications, and other factors that do and do not seem to facilitate cooperation in laboratory situations are discussed. In experiments with interrelated markets, the discussion covers failures (due to asymmetric quality information) and successes (where competition generates efficient coordination across markets).},

Following the change, the number of trades, quotes, and cancellations dropped by 30\% and market-wide bid-ask spreads rose by 9\%. Trading costs for market orders, measured by bid-ask spreads, increased for institutions, but remained unaffected for retail traders. Both groups incur higher adverse selection costs on their limit orders. Retail traders’ intraday returns, especially from limit orders, declined, while institutions’ returns from market orders increased.},

abstract = {Speeding up the exchange has a non-trivial effect on liquidity. On the one hand, more speed enables high-frequency market makers (HFMs) to update their quotes more quickly on incoming news. This reduces adverse-selection cost and lowers the competitive bid-ask spread. On the other hand, HFM price quotes are more likely to meet speculative high-frequency “bandits,” thus less likely to meet liquidity traders. This raises the spread. The net effect depends on a security’s news-to-liquidity-trader ratio. Empirical analysis of a NASDAQ-OMX speed upgrade shows that a faster market can indeed raise the spread and thus lower liquidity.},

We further show that prices, volumes, and spreads respond to the filing news beginning around 30 seconds before public posting, consistent with some market participants taking advantage of the posting delay. These results raise questions about whether the SEC dissemination process is really a level playing field for all investors.},

We measure and compare the impact of different types of information events on high-frequency trading (HFT) and non-HFT (NHFT) based on a NASDAQ high-frequency dataset. Information events are categorized into hard quantitative information shocks and soft qualitative shocks. We find that HFT reaction to hard information is stronger and faster than for soft information while NHFT reaction is stronger and slower for soft information. The HFT reaction is also reflected in trading profits: HFT profits after futures shocks are short-lived and highest in the short run. On the contrary, VIX and news shocks lead to increasing HFT profits. Furthermore, initiating traders and passive traders complement one another in price discovery: Initiating HFT have a higher influence on short-term price discovery than initiating NHFT and increasingly after hard information shocks. Passive NHFT on the other side have a higher influence in the long run and increasingly after soft information shocks.},
